This library serves as a utility belt for functional programming in F#.
It covers a wide spectrum of data types from the Option and Result monads to extensions over various collection types (including but not limited to Arrays, Sets, Maps (immutable dictionaries), Binary Heaps, Queues, Dequeues, Finger Trees, and more).
No code in the library is ever copied from another source, instead opting to implement everything myself from various reference sources.
I made that decision as well utility is a driving force for the library, learning is a co-lead, and implementing a new collection type or a new function over graphs, or whatever it may be, is a learning opportunity.
